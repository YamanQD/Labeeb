## Todo

-   Enable TypeScript's strict mode

## Architecture

This is my first attempt at applying a clean architecture in the frontend domain. I tried to learn from other people's repositories and articles on clean architecture and apply this knowledge where I think it fits in this project.

These are the resources that I learned from:

- https://github.com/huy-ta/flexible-counter-app
- https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture
- https://github.com/andoshin11/clean-architecture-example-vue (CHECK OUT ITS NETWORK FOLDER)
- https://github.com/slipstream00/reactjs-functions
- https://github.com/nanosoftonline/clean-architecture-express-contacts
- https://github.com/devbootstrap/SOLID-Principles-Examples-using-Typescript

## Testing

## Enhancements

-   Develop components in isolation using storybook
-   Enhance dark mode switching performance
