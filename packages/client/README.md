## Todo

-   Enable TypeScript's strict mode

## Testing

## Enhancements

-   Develop components in isolation using storybook
-   Enhance dark mode switching performance

## Design Tips

-   Keep margins consistent
-   Use a grid in figma (12 column)
-   Typography: Line-height between 1.2 and 1.4em
-   Gradients are smoother and more pleasant to look at than solid colors.
